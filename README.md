# Titanic Survival Prediction with Decision Tree

This project uses a Decision Tree Classifier to predict survival on the Titanic dataset. It is part of a machine learning learning series.

## 🚢 Dataset
Used the classic [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), which contains passenger information like:
- Age
- Sex
- Passenger class
- Fare
- Embarked location
- Survival status (target)

## 🧠 Model
- **Algorithm**: DecisionTreeClassifier (from `sklearn`)
- **Target**: `Survived`
- **Features used**: `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`

## 📊 Accuracy
Achieved model accuracy of **~87.99%** on training/testing split.
